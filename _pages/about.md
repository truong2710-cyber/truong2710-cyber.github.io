My current research interest mainly focuses on **Efficient Object Detection**. Specifically, I have been working on designing highly efficent architecture to boost the accuracy of object detector. Besides, I also have experiences working with heuristic, evolutionary algorithms for optimization in wireless sensor networks.   

In 2023, I reveived an excellent Bachelor Degree on Computer Science in Talented Program of **Hanoi Univeristy of Science and Technology (HUST)**. With a CPA of 3.9/4.0, I am ranked #1 in that program.

From Feb 2023 to May 2025, I had been working at VinAI Research and then Qualcomm AI Research as an AI Resident under the supervision of Prof. Minh Hoai Nguyen (The University of Adelaide) on **Efficient Object Detection**.

I am seeking a fully funded Master's opportunity in CS / AI & ML focusing on Medical AI / Efficient AI / Vision-language models / Foundation models.

Currently, I am a visiting researcher at **Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)**, where I focus on **Medical AI** under the guidance of Assistant Professor **Yutong Xie**.
