My current research interest mainly focus on **Efficient Object Detection**. Specifically, I work on designing highly efficent architecture to boost the accuracy of object detector. Besides, I also have experiences working with heuristic, evolutionary algorithms for optimization in wireless sensor networks.   

In 2023, I reveived an excellent Bachelor Degree on Computer Science in Talented Program of **Hanoi Univeristy of Science and Technology (HUST)**. With a CPA of 3.9/4.0, I am ranked #1 in that program.

Since Feb 2023, I have been working at VinAI Research as an AI Resident under the supervision of Prof. Minh Hoai Nguyen (The University of Adelaide) on **Efficient Object Detection**.
