abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, wireless sensor networks play a critical role in communication systems. One of the most crucial problems in wireless sensor networks is the sensor deployment problem, which attempts to provide a strategy to place the sensors within the surveillance area so that two fundamental criteria of wireless sensor networks, coverage and connectivity, are guaranteed. In this paper, we look to solve the multi-objective deployment problem so that area coverage is maximized and the number of nodes used is minimized. Since Harmony Search is a simple yet suitable algorithm for our work, we propose Harmony Search algorithm along with various enhancement proposals, including heuristic initialization, random sampling of sensor types, weighted fitness evaluation, and using different components in the fitness function, to provide a solution to the problem of sensor deployment in a heterogeneous wireless sensor network where sensors have different sensing ranges. On top of that, the probabilistic sensing model is used to reflect how the sensors work realistically. We also provide the extension of our solution to 3D areas and propose a realistic 3D dataset to evaluate it. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms solve the area coverage problem more efficiently than previous algorithms. Our best proposal demonstrates significant improvements in coverage ratio by 10.20% and cost saving by 27.65% compared to the best baseline in a large-scale evaluation.}

abstract = {Target coverage and connectivity problems are major challenges for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In practice, when different targets demand different priority levels, each target is assigned a value q which is the number of sensors covering it as well as the number of node-disjoint paths to transfer sensing data of itself to the base station. When q>1, the network can ensure fault tolerance. Those constraints are named Q-Coverage and Q-Connectivity. In this paper, we propose a two-phase solution for the problem: Greedy combined with Linear Programming (GLA) for Phase I and Clustering combined with graph Max Flow Approach (CMFA) for Phase II. Besides, we also evaluate the algorithms with multiple datasets and make some comparisons with baseline methods (ESSNP in phase I; CCMFA and FCSA in phase II). Our results show that the proposed algorithms significantly improve in various evaluation metrics compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the results can be advantageous for our future researches on WSNs in general and target coverage in particular.}
